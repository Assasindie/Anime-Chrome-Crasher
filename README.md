# Anime-Chrome-Crasher
A program that runs in the background and crashes chrome if the word anime is detected in the tab name.


Warning this program will boot itself up when you re-load up your computer. To remove the program from start up and kill any instances of it run the Remove Anime Chrome Crasher exe.


This is not intended for distribution or any use other than personal, however feel free to contribute :).

# Build:
Clone or Fork the repo.

Import the solution using Visual Studio,

Build the solution and projects. The first build will take some time as it will download all the necessary packages.

Run. 

If you need to close the program while testing outside of visual studio, either end via task manager or run Remove Anime Chrome Crasher.exe :)

Also need to change the values in the WeebHook.cs to be your webhooks ID and Token
