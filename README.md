# Anime-Chrome-Crasher
A program that runs in the background and crashes chrome if the word anime is detected in the tab name. It will also send some information about your tabs and computer name to a discord webhook, aswell as take a screenshot of your primary screen.


To kill any instances of this program and if you had an old version remove it from startup, run the Remove Anime Chrome Crasher exe.


This is not intended for distribution or any use other than personal and is mearly to show the potential of what you can do a c# application running in the background, however feel free to contribute :).

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

# Build:
Clone or Fork the repo.

Import the solution using Visual Studio,

Build the solution and projects. The first build will take some time as it will download all the necessary packages.

Run. 

If you need to close the program while testing outside of visual studio, either end via task manager or run Remove Anime Chrome Crasher.exe :)

Also need to change the values in the WeebHook.cs to be your webhooks ID and Token
